Predicting the `HOMO-LUMO Gap` of Molecules Based on Quantum Properties: `Comparison of Different Learning Models.`

`Dataset:` Transition Metals Quantum Mechanics dataset `(tmQM)`. 
The dataset is extracted from Cambridge Structural Database (CSD)). It has 86,665 data points. And is publicly available at: https:// github.com/bbskjelstad/tmqm

The `Neural Network model using the PyTorch framework` `outperformed` the other implemented  machine learning models, including Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Linear Regression, in terms of delivering the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) value.
